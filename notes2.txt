NOTE : About git 



# git have default branch which is master and then 
	if i want to create new branch then we can go for 
	[git checkout -b branch_name]
# and then if want to switch to that branch then use
	[git checkout branch_name] now our working branch is this (branch_name)

# we can modify or change anything in this branch both will be independent with 
	each other but at the same time if i want to marge both branch we can 
		murge it by using otheer command

### Till the time git command i have learend or use it is as folows
			[
				{
				git init <-- create .git in the folder to access git
				git status <-- check status of the git whether file is updated
								or not if updated then commit those changes
								but first try to check which branch currently 
								you are working
				git branch <-- it shows current branch.
				
				git add updated_file <-- new file got added to git for commit
				or 
				git add . <-- if you want to add multiple updated  file same time
								into git
				git commit -m "commit message"	<-- commit the file which we were
													added into git by using [git add .]									
				},
				(these all commit is happening localy if i want to commit into remote
					repositry or git repositry then we need to do few things)
				{
					step1: create a new repositry in github (project name should be same)
					step2: take the url of that project it should be something like this
								[git remote add origin https://github.com/rajeshpoddar26/GithubNotes.git]
								
					step3: to push the code into git 
							[git push -u origin main]
				}
				NOTE: suppose if you have two branch separate for example 
				
				master and sub_master then in this senario if i want to push 
				this sub_master into git repo then we need to use this command
					[git push -u origin --all]		
			]
			
			Diffrance between : 
									[git push -u origin --all] 
								and [git push -u origin master]
								and [git push fetch from origin main].
								
					Answer:	
						
						
						NOTE: if we are writing code in
							main branch then commit that branch only 
							by using [git push -u origin master]
						created main branch
